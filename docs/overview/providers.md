# Provider Integrations

This page provides an overview of all available provider integrations in the Serapeum framework. Providers implement the core abstractions to work with different LLM backends and services.

## Overview

Serapeum uses a **provider-based organization** where each provider package contains all features that provider offers (LLM, embeddings, and any provider-specific capabilities). This keeps related code together and makes it easy to install only the providers you need.

### Available Providers

- **[Ollama](providers/ollama.md)** - Local LLM inference with Ollama server
- **OpenAI** - OpenAI API integration (coming soon)
- **Azure OpenAI** - Azure OpenAI Service integration (in development)

---

## Provider Architecture

All providers follow the same architectural pattern:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Core Abstractions"
        A[BaseLLM Protocol]
        B[BaseEmbedding Protocol]
        C[FunctionCallingLLM]
    end

    subgraph "Provider Package"
        D[ProviderLLM]
        E[ProviderEmbedding]
        F[Shared Client]
        G[Provider Errors]
    end

    C --> A
    D --> C
    E --> B
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G
```

**Key Components:**

1. **LLM Implementation**: Inherits from `FunctionCallingLLM` to provide chat, completion, tool calling, and structured outputs
2. **Embedding Implementation**: Implements `BaseEmbedding` protocol for text and query embeddings
3. **Shared Client**: HTTP client and configuration shared across LLM and embedding classes
4. **Provider Errors**: Custom exceptions for provider-specific error handling

## Provider Comparison

| Provider | Status | LLM | Embeddings | Tool Calling | Streaming | Async |
|----------|--------|-----|------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **[Ollama](providers/ollama.md)** | ✅ Available | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **OpenAI** | 🚧 In Development | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 |
| **Azure OpenAI** | 🚧 In Development | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 | 🚧 |

## Installation

Each provider is distributed as a separate package. Install only the providers you need:

```bash
# Ollama provider
pip install serapeum-ollama

# OpenAI provider (when available)
pip install serapeum-openai

# Azure OpenAI provider (when available)
pip install serapeum-azure-openai

# Install multiple providers
pip install serapeum-ollama serapeum-openai
```

All provider packages depend on `serapeum-core`, which will be installed automatically.

## Adding New Providers

Want to integrate a new LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.) into Serapeum?

We've created a comprehensive guide that walks you through every step of implementing a new provider integration, from directory structure to testing and documentation.

**[📖 Read the Complete Provider Implementation Guide →](providers/adding-new-providers.md)**

### What You'll Learn

- **Directory Structure**: How to organize your provider package
- **LLM Implementation**: Step-by-step guide to implementing the LLM class
- **Embeddings**: How to add embedding support (if applicable)
- **Testing**: Writing comprehensive tests with proper markers
- **Documentation**: Creating user-facing documentation
- **Best Practices**: Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Quick Overview

All providers follow the same pattern:

1. **Inherit from Core Classes**: `FunctionCallingLLM` for LLMs, `BaseEmbedding` for embeddings
2. **Implement Required Methods**: Chat, completion, streaming (sync & async)
3. **Add to Workspace**: Configure in `pyproject.toml`
4. **Write Tests**: Unit tests and e2e tests with markers
5. **Document**: README, usage examples, and docs page

### Reference Implementation

The **[Ollama provider](https://github.com/serapeum-org/Serapeum/tree/main/libs/providers/ollama)** serves as a complete reference showing:

- Full LLM implementation with streaming and async support
- Embedding implementation with batching
- Shared client and error handling
- Comprehensive test suite
- Complete documentation

### Development Checklist

Use this checklist when implementing a new provider:

- [ ] Inherits from `FunctionCallingLLM` for LLM
- [ ] Implements `BaseEmbedding` for embeddings (if applicable)
- [ ] Supports sync, async, and streaming operations
- [ ] Includes comprehensive unit tests (≥95% coverage)
- [ ] Includes e2e tests with appropriate markers
- [ ] Has README with examples and configuration
- [ ] Has documentation page in `docs/overview/providers/`
- [ ] Exports public API in `__init__.py`
- [ ] Added to workspace in root `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Added to provider comparison table above
- [ ] Follows code style and type annotations
